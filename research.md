My research focuses on advancing quantum information science through integrated quantum photonics and its applications in secure communication, sensing, and information processing. I aim to transform foundational breakthroughs in quantum physics into practical, scalable technologies. For the large-scale secure deployment of communication and sensing integrated quantum resources in the quantum internet, my research focuses on three areas: high-performance on-chip continuous-variable quantum communication devices and system mechanisms, quantum-secure semi-device-independent on-chip quantum random number generation, and the practical security of quantum resources.
