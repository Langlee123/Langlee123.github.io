---

I am a PhD student at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  
   

## Research Interest
My research direction is on-chip quantum communication for quantum Internet. My research is mainly based on integrated quantum photonics to transform the mechanism innovation of basic science into a major technological breakthrough, so as to further promote the large-scale, efficient and secure deployment of quantum resources in the quantum Internet, including but not limited to continuous variable quantum communication, quantum access network, and the integration mechanism of quantum communication and sensing that breaks the basic physical limits. On-chip device independent/semi-device independent quantum random number generation, etc.
